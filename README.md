Uses: Multi-Activity, Location Services, Geocoding, Internet, APIs, Images, Camera, Gallery

### App Highlights
1. This app allows users within a company or organization to award each other “reward points” (and comments) as a thank you or a commendation for their performance on a task.
2. Users can create a profile for themselves and interact with the other users. Users can later edit/update their profile data and delete their profile. 
3. Users start with a fixed number of points that they can award to other users.
4. When a user awards points to another user, their point value is reduced by the amount they give. Once a user is out of points to give, they can no longer add new rewards until their points are renewed. Point renewal is not within the scope of this project.
5. Assume the process of resetting the points-to-award value (and the actual act of rewarding the employee) are out of scope for this project.
6. Created classes to represent the user profiles and the reward assignments.
7. Used an API to as the “back end” which holds user and reward data.
